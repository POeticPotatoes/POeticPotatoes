# Hi, I’m @POeticPotatoes!
My real name is Yang Iiyu, and I'm a dude in Singapore (born in 2001)

I’ve worked extensively with Java and C# in building backend API's with Spring-based app services and Azure Functions. I've also worked on Angular in Typescript for several frontend projects. Other languages I've used include Python, C, C++ and Javascript.

While I've been doing programming-related-work since 2011, I began using Java in 2019 by writing minecraft plugins with the Spigot library, and have just completed a software engineering internship at SuccessIT where I managed the designing, building, and deploying of both backend and frontend services, including the building of a login and encryption service, as well as structuring its interactions with other backends. I'll be enrolling in Nanyang Technology in August 2022 :)

Projects I worked on for my company were deployed on Azure Cloud with services including Composite Search, AzureSql, Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, App Services and more.

Things I plan to work on (personal projects):
- I recently installed Arch Linux and intend to post any config files for my setup
- Working on an SQL management Library named Truffle
- Learning C++ for competetive programming
- Going through Operating Systems with Ostep
- I'll work on my Google Foobar this June (and post my solutions here).
