# Hi, I’m @POeticPotatoes!
I’ve worked extensively with Java and C# in building backend REST API's with Spring and Azure Functions. I've also worked on Angular in Typescript for several frontend projects.

I began learning Java in 2019 by writing minecraft plugins with the Spigot library, and am currently a software engineering intern at SuccessIT where I'm building deploying and managing both backend and frontend services.

I also plan to work on my Google Foobar this June (and post my solutions here).
