# Hi, I’m @POeticPotatoes!
My real name is Yang Iiyu, and I'm a dude in Singapore (born in 2001).

I'm currently studying in the National University of Singapore (NUS) and am studying for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I was previously enrolled in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) until my transfer this year.

I have formerly trained with NTU's competitive programming team to compete in the Inter-Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC), and I previously achieved 12th place in the 2022 Asia-Manila regionals held in Manila on 15th December 2022.

I’ve worked extensively in the past with C# in building backend API's with Spring-based app services and Azure Functions. I've also worked on Angular in Typescript for several frontend projects. Other languages I've used include Python, C, and Javascript.

While I've been doing programming-related-work since 2011, I began using Java in 2019 by writing minecraft plugins with the Spigot library, and completed a software engineering internship at SuccessIT in July, where I managed the designing, building, and deploying of both backend and frontend services, including the creation of a login and encryption service, as well as structuring its interactions with other backends.

Projects I worked on for my company were deployed on Azure Cloud with services including Composite Search, AzureSql, Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, App Services and more.
